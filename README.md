# Doctor B. Honeydew's Dotfiles

This is a collection of my config files to help me get each of my
computers quickly bootstrapped. It's a work in progress and is
specifically tweaked with lots of assumptions about where I like
to place things.

## Pre-requisites

* Repository lives at `~/src/dotfiles`
* [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) is configured
* Ruby 1.9.2+ is installed with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)

## Installation

Run `bootstrap.rb` and do what it says (within reason).
