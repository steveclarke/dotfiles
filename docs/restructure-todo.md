- [ ] Create final commit with restructuring complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps Recommendation

**IMMEDIATE ACTION: Phase 12 - Installation Progress and Resumability**

### Phase 12 - Installation Progress and Resumability (Recommended Next)
**Why:** Add the ability to resume interrupted installations and track installation progress, building on the excellent logging and package management systems from Phases 10-11.

**Quick Start:**
1. Implement `.install-state` file for tracking completed steps
2. Create resumable installation functions that work with the unified package management
3. Add skip functionality for completed steps with integration to logging system
4. Test installation interruption and resumption scenarios

**Impact:** High - improves user experience for long installations and provides recovery capabilities
**Complexity:** Medium - requires state management and careful step tracking, but can leverage existing logging infrastructure

**Expected Outcome:** Resumable installations that track progress, skip completed steps, and provide detailed status information using the unified package management and logging systems.

### Alternative: Final Cleanup and Documentation
**Why:** Complete the restructuring project by finishing documentation and cleanup tasks.

**Quick Start:**
1. Update main README.md with all new features and structure
2. Create comprehensive migration guide for existing users
3. Clean up any remaining temporary files
4. Create final validation testing

**Impact:** Medium - completes the project and improves documentation
**Complexity:** Low - mostly documentation and cleanup work

### Recommended Choice: **Phase 12** (Installation Progress and Resumability)
Phase 12 will provide immediate user experience benefits by allowing long installations to be resumed if interrupted. The unified package management system from Phase 11 provides an excellent foundation for implementing granular installation tracking, and the logging system from Phase 10 will provide excellent visibility into the installation state.
