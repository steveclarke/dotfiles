# Development Guides

This directory contains process documentation and guides for AI-assisted development.

## Purpose

Development guides provide structured approaches and processes for building software with AI assistance. These guides are referenced by Cursor commands and other AI tools.

## Usage

These guides are not automatically available to any tool - copy them into your projects as needed. For Cursor-specific commands that are automatically available in Cursor, see [`configs/cursor/.cursor/commands/`](../../configs/cursor/.cursor/commands/).
