# Reusable Prompts

This directory contains reusable prompt templates for various development tasks.

## Purpose

Prompts are focused templates for specific tasks that can be used with any AI tool (Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.). Unlike Cursor commands which are app-specific, these prompts are tool-agnostic.

## Usage

These prompts are not automatically available to any tool - copy them into your projects as needed. For Cursor-specific commands that are automatically available in Cursor, see [`configs/cursor/.cursor/commands/`](../configs/cursor/.cursor/commands/).
