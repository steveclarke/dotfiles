# What to Capture in vision-discussion-summary.md

This document should be comprehensive and include:

## All Conversation Context

- Core problem identified and all nuances discussed
- Solution approach and how it evolved during discussion
- Technical feasibility discussions
- Architectural decisions made and their rationale
- Implementation ideas explored (even if not chosen)

## Technical Details

- Technology choices and why (SDKs, frameworks, protocols)
- Deployment architecture discussions
- Infrastructure considerations
- Technical constraints identified
- Integration points with existing systems

## Decisions & Rationale

- Key architectural decisions numbered with clear rationale
- What alternatives were considered
- Why certain approaches were chosen over others
- What was explicitly excluded and why

## Open Questions

- Questions that emerged during discussion
- What needs to be determined in requirements phase
- What needs to be determined in spec phase
- Technical unknowns to investigate

## Context for Future Phases

- Notes about team structure/roles that affect implementation
- Environment-specific behaviors (staging vs production vs local)
- Strategic context that influences technical decisions
- Anything discussed that will save time in requirements/spec/implementation

## Purpose

When creating requirements or spec documents, this summary provides all the context from vision planning without having to re-discuss everything. It bridges the gap between vision conversations and detailed technical work.
