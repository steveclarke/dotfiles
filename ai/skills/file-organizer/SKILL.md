## What This Skill Does

1. **Analyzes Current Structure**: Reviews your folders and files to understand what you have
2. **Finds Duplicates**: Identifies duplicate files across your system
3. **Suggests Organization**: Proposes logical folder structures based on your content
4. **Automates Cleanup**: Moves, renames, and organizes files with your approval
5. **Maintains Context**: Makes smart decisions based on file types, dates, and content
6. **Reduces Clutter**: Identifies old files you probably don't need anymore

## How to Use

### From Your Home Directory

```
cd ~
```

Then run Claude Code and ask for help:

```
Help me organize my Downloads folder
```

```
Find duplicate files in my Documents folder
```

```
Review my project directories and suggest improvements
```

```

```
Create a better folder structure for my [work/projects/photos/etc]
```

## Instructions

When a user requests file organization help:

1. **Understand the Scope**
   
   Ask clarifying questions:
   - Which directory needs organization? (Downloads, Documents, entire home folder?)
   - What's the main problem? (Can't find things, duplicates, too messy, no structure?)
   - Any files or folders to avoid? (Current projects, sensitive data?)
   - How aggressively to organize? (Conservative vs. comprehensive cleanup)

2. **Analyze Current State**
   
   Review the target directory:
   ```bash
   # Get overview of current structure
   ls -la [target_directory]
   
   # Check file types and sizes
   find [target_directory] -type f -exec file {} \; | head -20
   
   # Identify largest files
   du -sh [target_directory]/* | sort -rh | head -20
   
   # Count file types
   find [target_directory] -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
   ```
   
   Summarize findings:
   - Total files and folders
   - File type breakdown
   - Size distribution
   - Date ranges
   - Obvious organization issues

3. **Identify Organization Patterns**
   
   Based on the files, determine logical groupings:
   
   **By Type**:
   - Documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT)
   - Images (JPG, PNG, SVG)
   - Videos (MP4, MOV)
   - Archives (ZIP, TAR, DMG)
   - Code/Projects (directories with code)
   - Spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV)
   - Presentations (PPTX, KEY)
   
   **By Purpose**:
   - Work vs. Personal
   - Active vs. Archive
   - Project-specific
   - Reference materials
   - Temporary/scratch files
   
   **By Date**:
   - Current year/month
   - Previous years
   - Very old (archive candidates)

4. **Find Duplicates**
   
   When requested, search for duplicates:
   ```bash
   # Find exact duplicates by hash
   find [directory] -type f -exec md5 {} \; | sort | uniq -d
   
   # Find files with same name
   find [directory] -type f -printf '%f\n' | sort | uniq -d
   
   # Find similar-sized files
   find [directory] -type f -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -n
   ```
   
   For each set of duplicates:
   - Show all file paths
   - Display sizes and modification dates
   - Recommend which to keep (usually newest or best-named)
   - **Important**: Always ask for confirmation before deleting

5. **Propose Organization Plan**
   
   Present a clear plan before making changes:
   
   ```markdown
   # Organization Plan for [Directory]
   
   ## Current State
   - X files across Y folders
   - [Size] total
   - File types: [breakdown]
   - Issues: [list problems]
   
   ## Proposed Structure
   
   ```
   [Directory]/
   ├── Work/
   │   ├── Projects/
   │   ├── Documents/
   │   └── Archive/
   ├── Personal/
   │   ├── Photos/
   │   ├── Documents/
   │   └── Media/
   └── Downloads/
       ├── To-Sort/
       └── Archive/
   ```
   
   ## Changes I'll Make
   
   1. **Create new folders**: [list]
   2. **Move files**:
      - X PDFs → Work/Documents/
      - Y images → Personal/Photos/
      - Z old files → Archive/
   3. **Rename files**: [any renaming patterns]
   4. **Delete**: [duplicates or trash files]
   
   ## Files Needing Your Decision
   
   - [List any files you're unsure about]
   
   Ready to proceed? (yes/no/modify)
   ```

6. **Execute Organization**
   
   After approval, organize systematically:
   
   ```bash
   # Create folder structure
   mkdir -p "path/to/new/folders"
   
   # Move files with clear logging
   mv "old/path/file.pdf" "new/path/file.pdf"
   
   # Rename files with consistent patterns
   # Example: "YYYY-MM-DD - Description.ext"
   ```
   
   **Important Rules**:
   - Always confirm before deleting anything
   - Log all moves for potential undo
   - Preserve original modification dates
   - Handle filename conflicts gracefully
   - Stop and ask if you encounter unexpected situations

7. **Provide Summary and Maintenance Tips**
   
   After organizing:
   
   ```markdown
   # Organization Complete! ✨
   
   ## What Changed
   
   - Created [X] new folders
   - Organized [Y] files
   - Freed [Z] GB by removing duplicates
   - Archived [W] old files
   
   ## New Structure
   
   [Show the new folder tree]
   
   ## Maintenance Tips
   
   To keep this organized:
   
   1. **Weekly**: Sort new downloads
   2. **Monthly**: Review and archive completed projects
   3. **Quarterly**: Check for new duplicates
   4. **Yearly**: Archive old files
   
   ## Quick Commands for You
   
   ```bash
   # Find files modified this week
   find . -type f -mtime -7
   
   # Sort downloads by type
   [custom command for their setup]
   
   # Find duplicates
   [custom command]
   ```

## Examples

### Example 1: Organizing Downloads (From Justin Dielmann)

**User**: "My Downloads folder is a mess with 500+ files. Help me organize it."

**Process**:
1. Analyzes Downloads folder
2. Finds patterns: work docs, personal photos, installers, random PDFs
3. Proposes structure:
   - Downloads/
     - Work/
     - Personal/
     - Installers/ (DMG, PKG files)
     - Archive/
     - ToSort/ (things needing decisions)
4. Asks for confirmation
5. Moves files intelligently based on content and names
6. Results: 500 files → 5 organized folders

### Example 2: Finding and Removing Duplicates

**User**: "Find duplicate files in my Documents and help me decide which to keep."

**Output**:
```markdown
# Found 23 Sets of Duplicates (156 MB total)

## Duplicate Set 1: "proposal.pdf"
- `/Documents/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-15)
- `/Documents/old/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-15)
- `/Desktop/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-10)

**Recommendation**: Keep `/Documents/proposal.pdf` (most recent in correct location)
Delete the other 2 copies?

[Continue for all duplicates...]
```

### Example 3: Restructuring Projects Folder

**User**: "Review my ~/Projects directory and suggest improvements."

**Output**:
```markdown
# Analysis of ~/Projects

## Current Structure Issues
- Mix of active and archived projects (3+ years old)
- No consistent naming convention
- Some projects at root, others in random subfolders
- Duplicate folders (project-name, project-name-old, project-name-v2)

## Proposed Structure

```
Projects/
├── Active/
│   ├── client-work/
│   ├── side-projects/
│   └── learning/
├── Archive/
│   ├── 2022/
│   ├── 2023/
│   └── 2024/
└── Templates/
```

## Specific Changes
1. Move 12 projects not touched since 2022 → Archive/
2. Consolidate 4 duplicate project folders
3. Rename projects to consistent format: "client-name-project-name"
4. Create Archive for old work

Want me to implement this?
```

### Example 4: Organizing Photos by Date

**User**: "Organize my photo folders by year and month."

**Output**: Creates structure like:
```
Photos/
├── 2023/
│   ├── 01-January/
│   ├── 02-February/
│   └── ...
├── 2024/
│   ├── 01-January/
│   └── ...
└── Unsorted/
```

Then moves photos based on EXIF data or file modification dates.

## Common Organization Tasks

### Downloads Cleanup
```
Organize my Downloads folder - move documents to Documents, 
images to Pictures, keep installers separate, and archive files 
older than 3 months.
```

### Project Organization
```
Review my Projects folder structure and help me separate active 
projects from old ones I should archive.
```

### Duplicate Removal
```
Find all duplicate files in my Documents folder and help me 
decide which ones to keep.
```

### Desktop Cleanup
```
My Desktop is covered in files. Help me organize everything into 
my Documents folder properly.
```

### Photo Organization
```
Organize all photos in this folder by date (year/month) based 
on when they were taken.
```

### Work/Personal Separation
```
Help me separate my work files from personal files across my 
Documents folder.
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with one messy folder (like Downloads) to build trust
2. **Regular Maintenance**: Run weekly cleanup on Downloads
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use "YYYY-MM-DD - Description" format for important files
4. **Archive Aggressively**: Move old projects to Archive instead of deleting
5. **Keep Active Separate**: Maintain clear boundaries between active and archived work
6. **Trust the Process**: Let Claude handle the cognitive load of where things go

## Best Practices

### Folder Naming
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Avoid spaces (use hyphens or underscores)
- Be specific: "client-proposals" not "docs"
- Use prefixes for ordering: "01-current", "02-archive"

### File Naming
- Include dates: "2024-10-17-meeting-notes.md"
- Be descriptive: "q3-financial-report.xlsx"
- Avoid version numbers in names (use version control instead)
- Remove download artifacts: "document-final-v2 (1).pdf" → "document.pdf"

### When to Archive
- Projects not touched in 6+ months
- Completed work that might be referenced later
- Old versions after migration to new systems
- Files you're hesitant to delete (archive first)
