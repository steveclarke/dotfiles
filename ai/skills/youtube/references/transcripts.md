# YouTube Transcript Downloader

Download transcripts (subtitles/captions) from YouTube videos using yt-dlp.

## How It Works

### Priority Order:
1. **Check if yt-dlp is installed** - install if needed
2. **List available subtitles** - see what's actually available
3. **Try manual subtitles first** (`--write-sub`) - highest quality
4. **Fallback to auto-generated** (`--write-auto-sub`) - usually available
5. **Last resort: Whisper transcription** - if no subtitles exist (requires user confirmation)
6. **Confirm the download** and show the user where the file is saved
7. **Optionally clean up** the VTT format if the user wants plain text

## Installation Check

Check that yt-dlp is installed:

```bash
which yt-dlp || command -v yt-dlp
```

### If Not Installed

Attempt automatic installation based on the system:

**macOS (Homebrew)**:
```bash
brew install yt-dlp
```

**Linux (apt/Debian/Ubuntu)**:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y yt-dlp
```

**Alternative (pip - works on all systems)**:
```bash
pip3 install yt-dlp
# or
python3 -m pip install yt-dlp
```

**If installation fails**: Inform the user they need to install yt-dlp manually and provide them with installation instructions from https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation

## Check Available Subtitles

List what's available before downloading:

```bash
yt-dlp --list-subs "YOUTUBE_URL"
```

This shows what subtitle types are available without downloading anything. Look for:
- Manual subtitles (better quality)
- Auto-generated subtitles (usually available)
- Available languages

## Download Strategy

### Option 1: Manual Subtitles (Preferred)

Try this first - highest quality, human-created:

```bash
yt-dlp --write-sub --skip-download --output "OUTPUT_NAME" "YOUTUBE_URL"
```

### Option 2: Auto-Generated Subtitles (Fallback)

If manual subtitles aren't available:

```bash
yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --skip-download --output "OUTPUT_NAME" "YOUTUBE_URL"
```

Both commands create a `.vtt` file (WebVTT subtitle format).

## Option 3: Whisper Transcription (Last Resort)

Use this only when neither manual nor auto-generated subtitles exist.

### Step 1: Show File Size and Ask for Confirmation

```bash
# Get audio file size estimate
yt-dlp --print "%(filesize,filesize_approx)s" -f "bestaudio" "YOUTUBE_URL"

# Or get duration to estimate
yt-dlp --print "%(duration)s %(title)s" "YOUTUBE_URL"
```

Show the file size and ask: "No subtitles are available. I can download the audio (approximately X MB) and transcribe it using Whisper. Would you like to proceed?"

Wait for the user's answer before continuing.

### Step 2: Check for Whisper Installation

```bash
command -v whisper
```

If not installed, ask user: "Whisper is not installed. Install it with `pip install openai-whisper` (requires ~1-3GB for models)? This is a one-time installation."

Wait for the user's answer before installing.

Install if approved:
```bash
pip3 install openai-whisper
```

### Step 3: Download Audio Only

```bash
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 --output "audio_%(id)s.%(ext)s" "YOUTUBE_URL"
```

### Step 4: Transcribe with Whisper

```bash
# Auto-detect language (recommended)
whisper audio_VIDEO_ID.mp3 --model base --output_format vtt

# Or specify language if known
whisper audio_VIDEO_ID.mp3 --model base --language en --output_format vtt
```

Use `--model base` unless the user asks for more accuracy. Larger models
(`small`, `medium`, `large`) are more accurate but slower and need more memory.

### Step 5: Cleanup

After transcription completes, ask user: "Transcription complete! Would you like me to delete the audio file to save space?"

If yes:
```bash
rm audio_VIDEO_ID.mp3
```

## Getting Video Information

### Extract Video Title (for filename)

```bash
yt-dlp --print "%(title)s" "YOUTUBE_URL"
```

Use this to create meaningful filenames based on the video title. Clean the title for filesystem compatibility:
- Replace `/` with `-`
- Replace special characters that might cause issues
- Consider using sanitized version: `$(yt-dlp --print "%(title)s" "URL" | tr '/' '-' | tr ':' '-')`

## Post-Processing

### Convert to Plain Text (Recommended)

YouTube's auto-generated VTT files contain **duplicate lines** because captions are shown progressively with overlapping timestamps. Always deduplicate when converting to plain text while preserving the original speaking order.

```bash
python3 -c "
import sys, re
seen = set()
with open('transcript.en.vtt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        line = line.strip()
        if line and not line.startswith('WEBVTT') and not line.startswith('Kind:') and not line.startswith('Language:') and '-->' not in line:
            clean = re.sub('<[^>]*>', '', line)
            clean = clean.replace('&amp;', '&').replace('&gt;', '>').replace('&lt;', '<')
            if clean and clean not in seen:
                print(clean)
                seen.add(clean)
" > transcript.txt
```

### Complete Post-Processing with Video Title

```bash
# Get video title
VIDEO_TITLE=$(yt-dlp --print "%(title)s" "YOUTUBE_URL" | tr '/:' '_-' | tr -d '?"')

# Find the VTT file
VTT_FILE=$(ls *.vtt | head -n 1)

# Convert with deduplication
python3 -c "
import sys, re
seen = set()
with open('$VTT_FILE', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        line = line.strip()
        if line and not line.startswith('WEBVTT') and not line.startswith('Kind:') and not line.startswith('Language:') and '-->' not in line:
            clean = re.sub('<[^>]*>', '', line)
            clean = clean.replace('&amp;', '&').replace('&gt;', '>').replace('&lt;', '<')
            if clean and clean not in seen:
                print(clean)
                seen.add(clean)
" > "${VIDEO_TITLE}.txt"

echo "✓ Saved to: ${VIDEO_TITLE}.txt"

# Clean up VTT file
rm "$VTT_FILE"
echo "✓ Cleaned up temporary VTT file"
```

## Output Formats

- **VTT format** (`.vtt`): Includes timestamps and formatting, good for video players
- **Plain text** (`.txt`): Just the text content, good for reading or analysis

## Tips

- The filename will be `{output_name}.{language_code}.vtt` (e.g., `transcript.en.vtt`)
- Most YouTube videos have auto-generated English subtitles
- Some videos may have multiple language options

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**1. yt-dlp not installed**
- Attempt automatic installation based on system (Homebrew/apt/pip)
- If installation fails, provide manual installation link
- Verify installation before proceeding

**2. No subtitles available**
- List available subtitles first to confirm
- Try both `--write-sub` and `--write-auto-sub`
- If both fail, offer Whisper transcription option
- Show file size and ask for user confirmation before downloading audio

**3. Invalid or private video**
- Check if URL is correct format: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
- Some videos may be private, age-restricted, or geo-blocked
- Inform user of the specific error from yt-dlp

**4. Whisper installation fails**
- May require system dependencies (ffmpeg, rust)
- Provide fallback: "Install manually with: `pip3 install openai-whisper`"
- Check disk space: pip pulls in PyTorch (several GB); model files are 75MB–3GB

**5. Download interrupted or failed**
- Check internet connection
- Verify sufficient disk space
- Try again with `--no-check-certificate` if SSL issues occur

**6. Multiple subtitle languages**
- yt-dlp writes one subtitle language by default (English when available); use `--sub-langs <code>` or `--sub-langs all` for others
- Can specify with `--sub-langs en` for English only
- List available with `--list-subs` first
