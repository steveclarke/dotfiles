# AI/LLM Resources

This directory contains AI and LLM-related resources for development workflows, including guides and prompts.

## Directory Structure

- **[guides/](guides/)** - Development process documentation and guides
- **[prompts/](prompts/)** - Reusable prompt templates for various tasks

## Relationship to Cursor Commands

Cursor commands live in `configs/cursor/.cursor/commands/` as they are Cursor-specific configuration files managed by stow.

This `ai/` directory is for:
- Process guides that the commands reference (like feature-development-process.md)
- Reusable prompts for various development tasks
- Notes and learnings about working with AI tools

## Quick Start

1. **Using Guides**: Check `guides/` for process documentation
2. **Using Prompts**: Browse `prompts/` for reusable templates

## Contributing

When adding new resources:
- Guides go in `guides/` - process documentation
- Prompts go in `prompts/` - reusable templates
- Keep content generic and shareable (no project-specific details)
